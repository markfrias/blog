            <p>Here in New York, the air is crisp and the leaves have begun to turn crimson and brown. That can only mean one thing: hardware season is upon us. Backdropped by cloudy, gray Manhattan skies, Google  is set to take to the stage on Tuesda</p>
            <p>Then there was the issue that most users didn’t see the update for days after the announcement. In fact, here we are three weeks later and there are still people on Reddit and on other OnePlus forums — including the official one — saying they are still on Android 9 Pie.</p>

            <p>Things became even more confusing when, earlier this week, OnePlus took to a stage in London to launch the OnePlus 7T Pro for the first time (it also launched the OnePlus 7T, even though it already did that in India a week earlier). During that event, OnePlus co-founder Pete Lau gave us an update on when Android 10 will hit other OnePlus devices, going all the way back to the OnePlus 5.</p>
